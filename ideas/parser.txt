Think it should have a parser that looks at order text file and removes any line that is not a valid order,
then the rest can be processed.

per line
array of words delimited by spaces
line is a power or order
trim spaces
if not power, must be order
order[0] must be unitype - "A" or "F"
order[1] must be unitLocation "Bre" or "StP(sc)" etc.
order[2] must be order type ("h", "-", "s", "c")
hold - F Lon h
move - F Lon - ENG
support F NTH s Lon - ENG
convoy F ENG c Lon - Bre
